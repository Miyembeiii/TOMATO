## Author's comment
I really like to write down some details and information about each directory when I am working on that directory.
But, it is very very difficult to organise the notes in every separate directories in a project after writing. 
So I made my own tool to organise the notes and description for myself.
However, I know there will be some people like me - who likes just doing than carefully planning.
It will help you saving energy to switch your running mode to planning & structuring mode.
TOMATO will do it for you!
